# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding*

Submitted by: **John M. Pozo**

**Sea Monster** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **8-10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Y] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [Y] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [Y] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [Y] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Y] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

- Make a cool intro to get in the game, instead of a simple template, why not create it where the the intro has some animation with the logo
and title in the center. Since, is in the sea, there would be sea audio in the background. Thus, you enter, and then you will be shown a intro, show stats, show top funded game, runner up, our games, and really cool animation, maybe a transition effect in or out...or better. I'm tired at the moment, is 5:33 AM at the moment. I'm gonna go to sleep now.
